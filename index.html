            <h4>Celsius</h4>
            <p>The degree Celsius is a unit of temperature on the Celsius scale,[1] a temperature scale originally known
                as the
                centigrade scale.[2] The degree Celsius (symbol: °C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius
                scale or a unit
                to indicate a difference or range between two temperatures. It is named after the Swedish astronomer
                Anders Celsius
                (1701–1744), who developed a similar temperature scale in 1742. Before being renamed to honour Anders
                Celsius in 1948,
                the unit was called centigrade, from the Latin centum, which means 100, and gradus, which means steps.

            <h4>Fahrenheit</h4>
            <p>The Fahrenheit scale (/ˈfærənˌhaɪt, ˈfɑːr-/) is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by the
                physicist
                Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686–1736).[note 1][1] It uses the degree Fahrenheit (symbol: °F) as the
                unit. Several
                accounts of how he originally defined his scale exist, but the original paper suggests the lower
                defining point, 0 °F,
                was established as the freezing temperature of a solution of brine made from a mixture of water, ice,
                and ammonium
                chloride (a salt).[2][3] The other limit established was his best estimate of the average human body
                temperature,
                originally set at 90 °F, then 96 °F (about 2.6 °F less than the modern value due to a later redefinition
                of the
                scale).[2] However, he noted a middle point of 32 °F, to be set to the temperature of ice water.</p>

            <h4>Kelvin</h4>
            <p>The kelvin, symbol K, is the SI base unit of temperature,[1][2][3][4] named after the Belfast-born and
                University of
                Glasgow based engineer and physicist William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin (1824–1907). The Kelvin scale is
                an absolute
                thermodynamic temperature scale, meaning it uses absolute zero as its null point. It was developed by
                shifting the
                starting point of the much older Celsius scale down from the melting point of water to absolute zero and
                its increments
                still closely approximate the historic definition of a degree Celsius, but as of 2019 the scale is
                defined by fixing the
                numerical value of the Boltzmann constant k to 1.380649×10−23 J⋅K−1,[1] and the temperature in Celsius
                is defined[2] as
                the temperature in kelvins minus 273.15, meaning a change or difference in temperature has exactly the
                same value when
                expressed in kelvins as in Celsius, absolute zero is 0 K and -273.15 °C exactly, and pure water freezes
                very close to
                273.15 K and boils close to 373.15 K at standard atmospheric pressure.</p>
